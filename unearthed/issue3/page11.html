			<p class="justify">We are very proud of our long association with Q-West and Whale Watch Kaikōura. The fact that Kohler products are their preferred power generation is also a fantastic accomplishment. The order for the two Kohler 20.5EFKOZD was placed about 20 weeks ago and delivery was made to Whanganui last month.</p>

			<p class="justify">Scott says moving to a bigger vessel has paid dividends for Whale Watch Kaikōura and that their Manager, Roger Williams, can’t speak highly enough of Te Ao Marama.</p>

			<p class="justify">Historically their boats have been smaller, with smaller power plants and smaller power generation. Te Ao Marama is a game changer for the future of whale watching.</p>


			<p class="justify">Kohler offer the operation principle PGEN (Parallel Generation). This means the two units, automatically talk to each other via their controllers. It also optimizes the power output so they can either operate with one generator or bring the second generator online for higher loads, power demands and load shedding. You can also turn a generator off when you only need one. This is a premium feature of Kohler.</p>

			<h5>Meanwhile...</h5>

			<p class="justify">The two Kohler 80EFOZDJ going to Yachting Developments, will be put to use on a 34 metre sportfisher! If you’re wondering what a 34 metre sportfisher looks like, google Al Duhail. Al Duhail was built by Yachting Developments and was launched in Auckland in January 2020.</p>


			<p class="justify">The two Kohler 80EFOZDJ are due for delivery in April 2022. Scott says a sportfisher of this caliber can take 18 months to two years to build. We promise to share more on this project as it evolves and when information is released publicly.
			</p>

			<p class="justify"><strong> Well done to Scott and the team!</strong>
