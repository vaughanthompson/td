				An impressive collaboration between Blair Skevington of Skevingtons, Palfinger New Zealand,  Meister Solutions, and C&C Engineering has created an innovative and versatile digger crane - about to start work on its first job reconditioning South Otago's Waipori Dam. The base machine is a Volvo EC220DL.

					The Palfinger PK53002SH has been designed to replace the counterweight on the excavators extended subframe, creating a cleverly specâ€™d specialist unit.

				 With a 1580kg lifting capacity at a 21m reach, the digger crane has several impressive extra features: P-fold which enables the boom to fully unfold and refold from transport position to working position at the push of a button; High Performance Stability Control (HPSC) automatically downgrading lifting capacity when the crane is unable to anchor itself on fully extended stabiliser legs; and a two-workman basket.</p>
