			<p class="justify">What a year 2021 has been at TransDiesel! Our 40th year must have been one of our busiest and most challenging yet. While COVID continued to throw up a number of challenges there was so much to celebrate across our business some of which is detailed in our final newsletter for the year.</p>

			<p class="justify">Our business is built on the foundations of our people, partners and of course loyal customers. I would personally like to thank all our customers for their support through the year.</p>
