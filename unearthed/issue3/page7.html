                        With a 1580kg lifting capacity at a 21m reach, the digger crane has several impressive extra features: P-fold which enables the boom to fully unfold and refold from transport position to working position at the push of a button; High Performance Stability Control (HPSC) automatically downgrading lifting capacity when the crane is unable to anchor itself on fully extended stabiliser legs; and a two-workman basket.</p>
