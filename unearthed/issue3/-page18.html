			<p class="justify">“Shell and Hyundai have a very long standing collaboration working together both through lubricant development for the Hyundai vehicles and, more recently, Hayden Paddon and his rally programme,” said Jason Steele, Business Manager of Shell Lubricants.
            </p>
			<p class="justify">“We are proud to be able to announce our association with Hyundai as it shows their trust in our product.”</p>
			<p class="justify">To have a supplier agreement with an OEM is the ultimate tick of approval, one which is a demonstration of trust between the two organisations.
            </p>
            

            <p class="justify">“Shell Lubricants is able to supply a product to Hyundai specification and they have faith we can deliver time and time again,” said Mr Steele.

            <p class="justify">“It’s all about credibility and reliability.  If our product wasn’t up to it, then there’s no way we’d be able to engage in such a partnership.”
            </p>
			<p class="justify">Hyundai’s decision to engage with Shell Lubricants as a prefered supplier is also helped with bulk oil restocking via the TransDiesel ‘Pump-Over Truck’ delivery service.
            </p>
			<p class="justify">“We support the Hyundai business with bulk deliveries to the dealer network and continue to improve our support with continuity of supply with tools such as our Status Bulk Tank monitoring programme,” said Mr Steele.
