            <p class="justify">Tx generators are powered by a Baudouin PowerKit engine designed in France by Baudouin who have been in the engine business for over 100 years.</p>

			<p class="justify">We are targeting these sets as backup power for the bach, lifestyle blocks or small businesses and Tx generators are available with power outputs ranging from 11KVA through to 66KVA.</p>

			<p class="justify">We recently landed the first shipment and nearly all of these sets are sold, so more are now on order and we'll  be running a marketing campaign in the new year, once new stock is available.</p>
