                <p class="justify">The Kohler 20.5EFKOZD will be used in Whale Watch Kaikōura’s next waka. You may remember, TransDiesel supplied two Kohler 20.5EFKOZD marine gensets on Whale Watch Kaikōura’s Waka Te Ao Marama last year. Te Ao Marama has been so successful for Whale Watch Kaikōura, that they have commissioned a sister boat.</p>
