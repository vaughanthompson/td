			<p class="justify">Through the last 3 months shipping costs have increased anywhere from four to ten times what they were pre-COVID. International ports are congested. There has been a recent improvement at Auckland which has resulted in the shipping lines suspending or significantly reducing the congestion surcharge.</p>

			<p class="justify">Overall costs are stabilising at very high levels and shipping space is becoming more available. Our suppliers’ own supply chains have been disrupted and that is the main bottleneck for TransDiesel.</p>
			<p class="justify">However according to James Makoni, Supply Chain Manager, though it’s still tough out there, the Supply Chain Team are working hard to ensure suppliers are making and shipping our products on time.</p>
			<p class="justify">“Supplier costs are going up, as are shipping costs and the shipping space availability from USA and Italy is tight. Though this is a challenging situation for many of our competitors, due to forward planning and some hustling, <strong style="color:red"> TransDiesel is in a fortunate stock position, particularly for our spares and consumables business, which gives us a competitive advantage.</strong> This has led to us giving customers greater certainty of supply” says James.</p>
