                <h4>This is the first of 6 videos we filmed earlier in the year with our Shell technical support engineer and budding star Rob Lundie. The videos aim to answer commonly asked questions around a range of topics relating to lubricants to help position ourselves as technical experts in the market.</h4>

<h4>These videos will be promoted on our social channels, and sit on a dedicated Ask Rob landing page at transdiesel.com, so keep an eye out for the rest of the videos coming soon.
