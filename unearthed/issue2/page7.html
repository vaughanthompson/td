                <p class="justify">The Auckland 40th celebrations were a great success with a range of team, family and client events. Festivities started on Thursday 27th with a State of the Nation, BBQ and staff product day. On Friday, our customers were invited to join us at Stevenson’s quarry in Drury and they and the largest excavator Volvo make the EC950E.</p>
