			<p class="justify"><strong>Fieldays gave us an opportunity to showcase the TransDiesel brand and product range.</strong></p>

			<p class="justify">This year we chose to display 20 machines across Yanmar, Volvo and Kohler. We also included a Shell zone which featured a Shell racing simulator, Yanmar dig zone and HR careers zone. </p>
			
			<p class="justify">The Yanmar dig zone was a hit with customers wanting to ‘try before they buy’ and it also helped our team demonstrate the Yanmar’s key features.   </p>

			<p class="justify">With our Hautapu site opening just around the corner from Fieldays, the HR team took the opportunity to try and recruit some local talent. Some great leads came through and we will be following up on these in the next few weeks.</p>

			<p class="justify">On the Saturday (also known as family day) the team continued the tradition of giving our youngest fans a TransDiesel high vis vest.</p>
	
			<p class="justify"><strong>By the end of the day, it was obvious who had stopped by at our TransDiesel site.</strong></p>
