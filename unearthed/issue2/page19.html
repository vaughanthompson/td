			<p class="justify">According to Jason Steele our strong local heritage is a great fit with Hayden and Paddon Rallysport, as both brands are synonymous as being true ‘Kiwi Battlers’ - starting out small, putting in the hard yards and enjoying some great success along the way.</p>

            <p class="justify">There are five rounds of the NZ Rally Championship throughout 2021. The first was the Rally of Otago from April 16 – 18th where there were 49 entries with Hayden the clear favourite. However it was Christchurch’s Dylan Thomson that claimed victory in the opening round.</p>

            <p class="justify">The partnership will allow for some cross-promotional brand opportunities, social media collaboration as well as some exciting developments to coincide with TransDiesel’s 40th anniversary celebrations later in the year.</p>
