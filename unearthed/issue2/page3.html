			<p class="justify">Hi there. As of writing our New Zealand Olympics team have just finished the Tokyo games, reaching an incredibly impressive 13th spot in the medal rankings! It's apparent once again as a country we punch well above our weight- not just in sport but in business too.</p>

			<p class="justify">For us here at TransDiesel our golden moment is providing 40 years of service to New Zealand industries and it's a podium position we're really proud to celebrate.</p>

				<p class="justify">Coming together in a series of nationwide special events, it's been a privilege to share this achievement and tell a few yarns with customers old and new alike. Imagine what the 50th will be like!!</p>

			<p class="justify">Enjoy this issue and stay warm and dry (if you're lucky enough to be in a cab!)</p>
