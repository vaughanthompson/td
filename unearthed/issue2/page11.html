			<h5>“We completely focussed on existing customers as a priority and put a freeze on supply to any new customers. This was all about making sure our customers got through the supply issues unscathed”.</h5>

			<p class="justify">The situation is now beginning to resolve, and the team is starting to eat into the stockpile of lubricant so is now able to take on new customers who are still facing shortages from our competitors.</p>

			<p class="justify"><strong>Fonterra</strong> was one of those key customers that the team worked with closely to navigate the crisis and ensure they never ran out of stock. They have been a long-time customer of TransDiesel, and we supply all the lubricant for their tankers.</p>

		<p class="justify">The team began the conversations about supply issues with Fonterra early in the piece. We worked with them to develop a business continuity plan and we called their team in for discussions with the wider TransDiesel team.</p>

			<p class="justify">As a result of the way the team handled the situation, we have one very happy customer who is not only impressed with how TransDiesel managed the issues and maintained continuity of supply to their tanker fleet- but are also committed to partnering us by providing permission to feature their fleet in upcoming marketing material.</p>

			<p class="justify">A great example of an honest and transparent relationship between TransDiesel and our customer and our commitment to dealing with the issues up front.</p>
