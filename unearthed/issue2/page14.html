                <p class="justify">The Solomon Islands are located to the East of Papua New Guinea and include six major and over 900 smaller islands. Solar energy is the main source of energy for electricity supply but with demand growing and the requirement for more reliable and consistent power in the larger centres the Solomon’s need generators. </p>

                <p class="justify">The two generators we have sold are in addition to the KV700 and KD165 generators we provided in 2015 for use in the Noro, Gizo, Tualagi and the Auki power stations.The contract was originally for supply of the generators and installation and commissioning but due to Covid-19 travel restrictions it is now a supply only contract.</p>
                
                <p class="justify">The generators are being built in France at the Kohler factory in Brest and will be delivered late September.</p>
