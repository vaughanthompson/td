                <p class="justify">The launch of the Customer Care Team is directly aligned with our business vision of offering the best service to our customers. Part of achieving that goal is ensuring that we answer our customerâ€™s question quickly and ensure that we are getting the right products and services to our customers when they need them.</p>

                <p class="justify">The initial team of three, expected to grow as the teams' tasks are increased, includes Team Leader Steven Thomson and Customer Care Reps Daniel Hayes and Rachael Halder. The core function of the team will be transitioning as many customers as possible to using the TradeDoor portal on a regular basis.</p>

				<p class="justify"> The team will support the consumables field team and look after selected customers. Overall, the interaction from the NCSC and their day-to-day tasks will enhance our customer experience and lift our communication so they become a centre of excellence across the business, working and supporting internal and external customers across all fields.</p>
