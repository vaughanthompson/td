			<p class="justify">A new delivery service will provide bulk restocking of lubricants to key customers in the South Island. “We first debuted a Pump-Over Truck in the North Island about 12-months ago and, based on its popularity, we're now launching the service on the mainland.” said Jason Steele, TransDiesel Business Manager for Shell Lubricants.
			</p>
			<p class="justify">“Utilising the Pump-Over Truck has enabled us to make significant operational and efficiency improvements as well as providing cost reductions for our customers.”</p>
			<p class="justify">The vehicle can carry and pump from both Immediate Bulk Containers (IBCs) and barrels, as well as transport smaller packs loaded on pallets for transfer to less easily-accessible locations.</p>

			<p class="justify">Capable of delivering consumables ranging from Shell Tellus S2 MX 22 light hydraulic fluids all the way through to heavy gear oils such as Shell Spirax S2 A 85W-140, the truck will also carry heavy-duty diesel Rimula engine oils for heavy-equipment users, and top-tier Helix passenger car oils for automotive garages and commercial fleet operators.</p>
			<p class="justify">Customer tanks are connected to a remote monitoring system, ensuring lubricant never gets below a minimum level- providing the ability to operate to ‘just-in-time’ principles and order new product for delivery as and when required.</p><p class="justify">With both trucks in operation, we now have the ability to service the entire country with bulk oil and lubricant delivery.</p>
