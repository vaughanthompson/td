			<p class="justify">A brand-new lubricant delivery service introduced will enhance the restocking of product to key operators throughout the South Island. “We first debuted a Pump-Over Truck in the North Island about 12-months ago and, based on its overwhelming success, decided to launch one to assist our customers throughout the South Island,” said Jason Steele, TransDiesel Business Manager for Shell Lubricants.
			</p>
			<p class="justify">“Utilising the Pump-Over Truck has enabled us to make significant operational improvements from an efficiency perspective as well as cost reductions for our customers as they only pay for what they use.”</p>
			<p class="justify">The new Pump-Over Bulk Delivery Truck can carry and pump from both Immediate Bulk Containers (IBCs) and barrels, as well as transport smaller packs loaded on pallets for transfer to less easily-accessible locations.</p>

			<p class="justify">Capable of delivering consumables ranging from Shell Tellus S2 MX 22 light hydraulic fluids all the way through to heavy gear oils such as Shell Spirax S2 A 85W-140, the truck will also be pumping a full portfolio of heavy-duty diesel Rimula engine oils for heavy-equipment users, and top-tier Helix passenger car oils for automotive garages and commercial fleet operators.</p>
			<p class="justify">Each customer tank is connected to a remote monitoring system, which is used to ensure the tanks never get below a minimum level and provides the ability to operate to ‘just-in-time’ principles and order new product for delivery as and when required.</p><p class="justify">With both trucks in operation, we now have the ability to service the entire country with bulk oil and lubricant delivery.</p>
