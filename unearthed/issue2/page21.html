			<h2>The theme of this year’s TransDiesel Leadership summit was High Performance Leadership in a rapidly changing environment – very appropriate for our current circumstances.</h2>         
			<br>
			<h4>While the Leadership summits are action packed days, they enable us to bring our leaders together to learn from each other, discuss what’s going on in our world, seek out solutions and enjoy time together as a team.</h4>

			<p class="justify">This year we took an inward look at our personal working styles, compared them to others on the team and then explored what those differences mean when we work together as a group - how do we leverage strengths and accommodate differences?</p>         
			<p class="justify">A key highlight was the launch of the Learning & Development framework which we will be presenting to the rest of the business in the coming months. </p>   
			<p class="justify">As always when you get a group of TransDiesel people together, there was robust and healthy debate covering a huge range of topics. </p>

			<p class="justify">We were fortunate to have insights from one of Canterbury’s most recognised leaders – Razor Robertson - who was generous in sharing the Crusaders approach to leadership and how it has contributed to winning five national titles in a row.</p>  
			
			<p class="justify">Not sure if you will see any of the team breaking out in Razors traditional post match dance routine but keep an eye out!</p>  

			<p class="justify">The last day was focused on personal learning – having professional conversations and recruitment techniques. A Q&A with the Executive Leadership team was a fitting end to the hugely successful two day summit. Thanks to everyone for taking time to be there.</p>
