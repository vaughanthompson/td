<p class="justify"> Earlier this year we made the decision that our client and staff stories were too good not to share. At a time when businesses are looking for inspiration and aspirational stories of growth and success, we decided it was time to
share some of the good stuff going on within our business circle.</p>

<p class="justify">One thing worthy of recognition is our 40 th birthday celebrations this year. Our planning to celebrate this event with clients and staff is well underway with the 40-year celebration also coinciding with the start of our ten year relationships with Volvo and Yanmar. Our business has come a long way
since those pioneering days in the late 1970’s when three young Kiwis were in the UK on their big OE. If you want to know more about the inspiring TransDiesel story, check out our <a href="https://www.transdiesel.com/blog/Our-Story-TransDiesel-Ltd" target="_blank">brand story video</a>, it’s definitely worth a watch.</p>
<p class="justify">I can quite honestly say that the last twelve months have been some of the toughest in my business career in terms of managing the uncertainty that COVID-19 presented. No one can say this has been easy.</p>

<p class="justify">From lockdown to changing Alert levels and social distancing to hand sanitising it’s all been a roller coaster.</p>

<p class="justify">It’s been amazing to see the way people have adapted and improvised to make the best of this unprecedented situation. Our teams have gone out of their way to make sure clients receive the same level of service you have come to expect, and I know that many of you have had to “pivot” to accommodate change.</p>

<p class="justify">What has been great to see is the ongoing high levels of business confidence in our sector, post lockdown. I know this has been helped by the central government commitment to accelerate shovel ready projects, plus the increase in construction nationwide, and it does mean that as a sector we are sitting in a strong position.</p>
