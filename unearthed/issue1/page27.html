			<p class="justify">Shane started the business in 2016 and has had a long history with Volvo machines so, it made sense to continue with that relationship when he established 4ward Harvesting. </p>    
			<p class="justify">Shane originally purchased   a second-hand EC290CL high n wide with a NZ guarding package from TransDiesel, followed by the purchase of a new Volvo EC250DL forestry carrier. Since then, Shane has gone on to replace and upgrade his Volvo machinery with a new EC300DL Forestry carrier and a new EC250DL Forestry carrier. He enjoys the reliability of Volvo and the back up provided by TransDiesel from a general service point of view.</p>

            <p class="justify">
                The Volvo EC300DL has been equipped with a quick hitch to enable changing from a grapple machine to a bucket machine and to assist the crew’s production in Tokoroa while the EC250DL Fleets and loads on the landing and bunches logs in the cutover with the EC300DL put to work loading trucks and completing minor on site earthworks.</p>
