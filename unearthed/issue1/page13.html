            <p class="justify">“The race is on to respond to the EV challenge and the issue is here to stay. Electromobility is not only changing the automotive world but also how we plan our cities and infrastructure. As a sector, we must find workable and practical options to deliver on the drive from our customer base to respond to this challenge. There is a great deal of work going on in this space and TransDiesel want to be at the forefront of delivery.</p>
            <p class="justify">Campbell is also of the view that employees are looking for their employer to behave in a less traditional way and offer more flexibility in conditions and behaviours and was impressed with the work TransDiesel has done in this space, particularly on the back of dealing with COVID.</p>

            <p class="justify">“We are seeing more and more people who want to work for businesses that can demonstrate a strong social commitment. Whether that be a new way of working or a values base that enables both the business and employees to do good, the philosophy is here to stay.”</p>
            <p class="justify">TransDiesel already has a commitment in that space and is leading the way with waste management minimisation options. The business is a partner with Shell Lubricants and a small group of other lubricant manufacturers and distributors in funding New Zealand’s Waste Lubricant Container Product Stewardship Scheme, with a goal of bringing the sector together to find the best solution for removal of oil residue to enable recycling.</p>
            <p class="justify">“This kind of initiative is what makes a business stand out to a new generation of employees and it’s important that as a Board we support and enable ingenuity in this space. As a Board member that’s our role. We don’t run the business, but we do set strategic direction to enable the business to excel in a range of areas, not just financial.”</p>
            
            <p class="justify">Board chair, Craig Boyce, said he is delighted to have Greg Campbell on the governance team.“It is an endorsement of TransDiesel to have someone of Greg’s calibre, expertise and background knowledge join the board,” concluded Craig.</p>
