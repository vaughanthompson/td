			<p class="justify">The final product I want to touch on is our new TX Rubber Track range that uses superior high-grade rubber in the construction process to help ensure the new belts are more durable and less prone to tearing while still giving the operator a noticeably smoother ride.  In addition, they feature reinforced steel which further enhances all-round performance, longevity and durability. We are having great success with this product and I would encourage operators to talk to your TransDiesel rep about this product.</p>
