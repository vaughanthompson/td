			<p class="justify">We retained our position as number 1 Diesel engine supplier in New Zealand during the 2020 calendar year which means we have now held the number one position for 14 years in a row. The business also retained the number one position for marine generator sales for a fifth year. This success isn’t down to luck. It’s down to great people and great product and we are very fortunate to have both on the team.</p>
			<p class="justify">Our construction equipment division also had a strong twelve months with demand for product continuing to grow and we retained our number one position for excavators, wheel loaders and articulated dump trucks, when combined together. This is great news as it indicates not just growth for our business, but for all those other suppliers and contractors who do well when our sector does well.</p>

			<p class="justify">It is now twelve months since we took over the distribution agreement for Shell Lubricants. After twelve years working with ENI oil products, it was a big decision for us to shift partners and the decision has paid off, with sales exceeding initial expectations and all preliminary targets met.</p>

			<p class="justify">For me, this success is an example of how a business can shake up a sector simply by applying the principles of excellent service and caring about customer outcomes.
