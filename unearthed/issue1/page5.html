			<p class="justify">It is now twelve months since we took over the distribution agreement for Shell Lubricants. After twelve years working with ENI oil products, it was a big decision for us to shift partners and the decision has paid off, with sales exceeding initial expectations and all preliminary targets met.</p>

			<p class="justify">For me, this success is an example of how a business can shake up a sector simply by applying the principles of excellent service and caring about customer outcomes.

			<p class="justify">These twelve months havenâ€™t been easy.  Like the rest of the country, we have grappled with supply chain issues and the TransDiesel team have really gone the extra mile to make sure we were able to meet expectations. Just goes to show we really do have your back!</p>
