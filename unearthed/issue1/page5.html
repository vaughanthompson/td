The business also retained the number one position for marine generator sales for a fifth year. This success isn’t down to luck. It’s down to great people and great product and we are very fortunate to have both on the team.</p>

In addition, Shell Lubricants has one of the largest relationships as an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) both locally and internationally, providing OEM supplies across several sectors.</p>

				<p class="justify">The past twelve months haven’t been easy in this space. Like the rest of the country, we have grappled with supply chain issues and the TransDiesel team have really gone the extra mile to make sure we were able to meet expectations. </p>
