            <p class="justify"> When we asked Jason if there is anything the business can do to assist with the team’s goals, Jason said, carry on doing what you are already doing!</p>
           
            <p class="justify"> “The success we have seen over the last 12 months is because the TransDiesel team are all doing their bit. I look at the Supply Chain team, who have done an amazing job to get product here in such a crazy time, whether that be production or persuading shipping companies to prioritise our shipments. We don’t often stop to thank them for having product in the warehouse, but we all speak up when it’s not there.  </p>

        <section>
            <p class="justify">Also, our warehouse teams who are the backbone of getting product to our customers. We have seen examples of people going above and beyond to get shipments in and out on the same day and jumping through a few hoops to make things happen. The best bit is they always have a smile on their face.”</p>

            <p class="justify">The team have some very exciting customers this year, a couple of big stand outs for Jason include one of New Zealand’s leading Agriculture distributors, with 45 dealers, and a leading automotive OEM with 75 dealers.</p>
