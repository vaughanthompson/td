			<p class="justify"> TransDiesel purchased four hectares of land in the Waikato last year as the new base for our national distribution centre (machines and parts) and our Hamilton aftersales team.</p>

			<p class="justify">While Auckland has been the home of our national distribution centre for many years, significant growth meant that yard space was no longer large enough for machine storage and as a result we were forced to rent additional space to take the overload. </p>
			
			<p class="justify">Following a comprehensive search, we purchased land in Hautapu, between Cambridge and Hamilton in a high-profile position on State Highway 1. Hamilton is quickly becoming recognised as a great satellite suburb for Auckland city and land is certainly more affordable. </p>

			<p class="justify">The build includes a five bay workshop and 3,000sqm of warehouse and will be completed by October 2021. </p>
