            <h4>Construction of new TransDiesel premises in the Waikato is well underway. TransDiesel purchased four hectares of land in the Waikato last year as the new base for our national distribution centre (machines and parts) and our Hamilton aftersales team.

			<p class="justify">While Auckland has been the home of our national distribution centre for many years, significant growth meant that yard space was no longer large enough for machine storage, as a result we were forced to rent additional space to take the overload. This situation prompted us to look at options for expansion and with land in Auckland now fetching serious prices we took our search further afield.</p>


            <p class="justify">Hamilton is quickly becoming recognised as a great satellite suburb for Auckland city and land is certainly more affordable. So, it made sense for us to start investigating options in the area. Following a comprehensive search, we purchased land in Hautapu, between Cambridge and Hamilton in a high-profile position on State Highway 1. </p>

			<p class="justify">We have taken a staged approach to the build with the first stage of construction including a five-bay workshop,</p>
