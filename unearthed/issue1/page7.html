			<p class="justify"> TransDiesel purchased four hectares of land in the Waikato last year as the new base for our national distribution centre (machines and parts) and our Hamilton aftersales team.

				While Auckland has been the home of our national distribution centre for many years, significant growth meant that yard space was no longer large enough for machine storage and as a result we were forced to rent additional space to take the overload.
				
				Following a comprehensive search, we purchased land in Hautapu, between Cambridge and Hamilton in a high-profile position on State Highway 1. Hamilton is quickly becoming recognised as a great satellite suburb for Auckland city and land is certainly more affordable.
				
				The build includes a five bay workshop and 3,000sqm of warehouse and will be completed by October 2021.
				
				Our Rotorua team have also shifted into newly constructed premises and work has started on our new building in Taup≈ç.</p>
