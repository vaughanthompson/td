            <p class="justify"> “Last year was pretty intense and yet we still managed to exceed expectations. Now we are tooling up to support those gains and build the foundations for future growth.  This means a few team changes. We have appointed a Key Account Manager, John McElhinney, and we are about to appoint a new National Sales Manager.  We don’t need to go out and look for more business, we just need to ensure we deliver and expand with cross selling of products and services.</p>

            <p class="justify">Last year saw us introduce additional resource to our technical team. Rob Lundie joined as our Shell Technical Support Engineer and his expertise has brought another level of knowledge which we will be looking to leverage through the provision of new training and support to staff and customers.”</p>

            <p class="justify"> “We are also investing heavily in the service side of the business and have just purchased an 8 wheeler curtain-sider truck that is being fitted out with a custom made bulk pump over module for onsite pump over of bulk lubes. This unit will be based in Christchurch and will service the South Island.”</p>

            <p class="justify"> When we asked Jason if there is anything the business can do to assist with the team’s goals, Jason said, carry on doing what you are already doing!</p>
            <p class="justify"> “The success we have seen over the last 12 months is because the TransDiesel team are all doing their bit. I look at the Supply Chain team, who have done an amazing job to get product here in such a crazy time, whether that be production or persuading shipping companies to prioritise our shipments. We don’t often stop to thank them for having product in the warehouse, but we all speak up when it’s not there.  </p>
            <p class="justify">Also, our warehouse teams who are the backbone of getting product to our customers. We have seen examples of people going above and beyond to get shipments in and out on the same day and jumping through a few hoops to make things happen. The best bit is they always have a smile on their face.”</p>
