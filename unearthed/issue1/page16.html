            <p class="justify">When we started our relationship with Shell, we knew that there were huge opportunities for growth. And, while the Covid lockdown and fall out could have been a difficult challenge, it also gave us the opportunity to create an environment where we could step up as a supplier and show our value. We did just that!</p>

            <p class="justify">Jason says that as part of our agreement with Shell we have some lofty volume targets to achieve. However, by the end of December 2020 we had achieved 139% of those targets and we have secured business for 2021 which will see that volume grow by another 50%.</p>

        <section>
            <p class="justify">The focus for Jason and the team over the coming months is simple – deliver on our promises. The business is tooling up to make that happen with the addition of new team members, expertise and resources to the group.</p>
