            <p class="justify">When we started our relationship with Shell, we knew that there were huge opportunities for growth. And, while the Covid lockdown and fall out could have been a difficult challenge, Jason says it gave us the opportunity to create an environment where we could step up as a supplier and show our value. We did just that!</p>
            <p class="justify">“We have more than doubled the volume of oil held in stock and demonstrated the local support TransDiesel can provide. The gains we have made in the past six months have been huge and we have exceeded expectations.”</p>
            <p class="justify">Jason says that as part of our agreement with Shell we have some lofty volume targets to achieve. However, by the end of December 2020 we had achieved 139% of those targets and we have secured business for 2021 which will see that volume grow by another 50%.</p>

        <section>
            <p class="justify">The focus for Jason and the team over the coming months is simple – deliver on our promises.</p>

           
            <p class="justify"> “Last year was pretty intense and yet we still managed to exceed expectations. Now we are tooling up to support those gains and build the foundations for future growth.  This means a few team changes. We have appointed a Key Account Manager, John McElhinney, and we are about to appoint a new National Sales Manager.  We don’t need to go out and look for more business, we just need to ensure we deliver and expand with cross selling of products and services.</p>
            <p class="justify">Last year saw us introduce additional resource to our technical team. Rob Lundie joined as our Shell Technical Support Engineer and his expertise has brought another level of knowledge which we will be looking to leverage through the provision of new training and support to staff and customers.”</p>
