            <p class="justify">Jason Steele, Business Manager – Shell Lubricants, says if you had told him a year ago, we would go through what we did and be where we are today, he would never have believed you!</p>
            <p class="justify">“After 12 years working with ENI, it was a big decision to move away and start with something new, but a year on it’s clear it was the best thing we did. We are exceeding expectations and targets, and we are super excited about what lies ahead in 2021."</p>
            <p class="justify">When we started our relationship with Shell, we knew that there were huge opportunities for growth.</p>

            <p class="justify">And, while the Covid lockdown and fall out could have been a difficult challenge, it also gave us the opportunity to create an environment where we could step up as a supplier and show our value. We did just that!</p>
            <p class="justify">Jason says that as part of our agreement with Shell we have some lofty volume targets to achieve. However, by the end of December 2020 we had achieved 139% of those targets and we have secured business for 2021 which will see that volume grow by another 50%.</p>
