			<p class="justify">"As a provider of key equipment and services that will be required to deliver on the core infrastructure projects that New Zealand has lined up for delivery, TransDiesel has a strong and sustainable future. I am pleased to be involved with a provider to the sector that is held in such high regard.</p>

			<br>

            <h5>“I am also impressed with the great people that work at TransDiesel. They are knowledgeable and provide a great service. That’s essentially what customers and clients look for when making significant purchasing decisions.”</h5>

			<p class="justify">Campbell believes one of the biggest challenges facing the sector is the requirement to acknowledge and respond to climate change and environmental issues. One of the key ways to respond to the challenge is the development of an effective EV option for the heavy machinery sector.</p>

			<p class="justify">“The race is on to respond to the EV challenge, and the issue is here to stay. As a sector, we must find workable and practical options to deliver on the drive from our customer base. There is a great deal of work going on in this space and TransDiesel want to be at the forefront of delivery.</p>
            <p class="justify">Campbell is also of the view that employees are looking for their employer to behave in a less traditional way and offer more flexibility in conditions and behaviours and was impressed with the work TransDiesel has done in this space, particularly on the back of dealing with COVID.</p>

            <p class="justify">Board chair, Craig Boyce, said he is delighted to have someone of Greg’s calibre on the governance team.</p>
