				<p class="justify">“When it comes to excavators, no brand does it better.

				<p class="justify">A key enhancement of the E-Series is an engine upgrade to Stage 5 Emission compliance, which improves fuel efficiency, and highlights Volvo’s ‘high torque, at low RPM reputation. An upgraded hydraulics system raises pump power for smoother and faster operation, which results in quicker cycle times, higher productivity and lower operating costs.</p>

				<p class="justify">A variety of working modes including idle, fine, general, heavy and power max are also available.</p>

				<p class="justify">“Volvo’s vision in the environmental space with regards to sustainability aligns with our own company ideals. Our Volvo excavators are working in some remote and pristine locations around New Zealand across a range of different applications.”
