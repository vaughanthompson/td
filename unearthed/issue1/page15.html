            <h4>In February we celebrated the 1-year anniversary of signing the distribution agreement with Shell and even though we have only been actively trading Shell for 10 months, it’s been a very eventful period.</h4>

            <p class="justify">Jason Steele, Business Manager – Shell Lubricants, says if you had told him a year ago, we would go through what we did and be where we are today, he would never have believed you!</p>
            <p class="justify">“After 12 years working with ENI, it was a big decision to move away and start with something new, but a year on it’s clear it was the best thing we did. We are exceeding expectations and targets, and we are super excited about what lies ahead in 2021."</p>
            <p class="justify">When we started our relationship with Shell, we knew that there were huge opportunities for growth. And, while the Covid lockdown and fall out could have been a difficult challenge, Jason says it gave us the opportunity to create an environment where we could step up as a supplier and show our value. We did just that!</p>

                <p class="justify">“We have more than doubled the volume of oil held in stock and demonstrated the local support TransDiesel can provide. The gains we have made in the past six months have been huge and we have exceeded expectations.”</p>
				<p class="justify">Jason says that as part of our agreement with Shell we have some lofty volume targets to achieve. However, by the end of December 2020 we had achieved 139% of those targets and we have secured business for 2021 which will see that volume grow by another 50%.</p>
				<p class="justify">The focus for Jason and the team over the coming months is simple – deliver on our promises.</p>
