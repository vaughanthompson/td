            <p class="justify">The new TX Tracks feature durable construction for enhanced longevity, deliver improvements in comfort and come with an attractive warranty proposition.</p>
            <p class="justify">“Excavator operators often have to contend with rugged conditions by virtue of the machinery they are operating, so any gains in durability and toughness can only be a good thing,” said Mark Patrick, Business Development Manager.</p>
            <p class="justify">“We are launching the new TX Rubber Track which, thanks to the use of superior high-grade rubber in the construction process, helps ensure the new belts are noticeably more durable and less prone to tearing while still giving the operator a noticeably smoother ride.</p>
            <p class="justify">“In addition, they feature reinforced steel which further enhances all-round performance, longevity and durability and for added peace of mind they are backed with a pro-rata 12-month warranty, making fitment of the new track essentially a no-risk business proposition.”</p>
