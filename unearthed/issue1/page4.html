			<p class="justify">However, here at TransDiesel we are constantly looking at ways to continue to enhance the strategic and innovative partnerships we have with our customers and to make sure that we are continuously improving our support of your business. As part of that push to increasing our service commitment, TransDiesel is establishing a National Customer Service Centre which is scheduled to be operational later this year. This is part of our strategy to improve the experience that customers have when they interact with our business. You will hear more about this later in the year.</p>

			<p class="justify">Earlier this year TransDiesel shifted membership to become part of the Volvo International region. Customers will not notice any difference in service or product availability, but this is a recognition of our regions demand for the latest technology in our construction machinery. With Volvo being a market leader in the development of machine automation and other technology advancements, this has been a positive move for us. Our businesses are very aligned in philosophy and brand with their purpose being - “Building the world we want to live in”.</p>

			<p class="justify">Finally, we have recently completed a shift to newly built premises in our Rotorua branch and work has started on a new building for our Taupō team. We have also started construction of our national distribution centre and our Hamilton aftersales teams premises in Hautapu in the Waikato. More about this later!</p>
