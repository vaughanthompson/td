		<p class="justify">We retained our position as number 1 Diesel engine supplier in New Zealand during the 2020 calendar year which means we have now held the number one position for 14 years in a row. The business also retained the number one position for marine generator sales for a fifth year. This success isn’t down to luck. It’s down to great people and great product and we are very fortunate to have both on the team.</p>

This is great news as it indicates not just growth for our business, but for all those other suppliers and contractors who do well when our sector does well.</p>
