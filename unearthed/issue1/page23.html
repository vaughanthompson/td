            <p class="justify">To coincide with the launch of the new TX Rubber Track, the team at TransDiesel created their own advertisement for the product.</p>

            <p class="justify">“We had a lot of fun producing the commercial which supports this new product release,” said Marketing Manager, Marc Warr.<br>“It stars many of our own TransDiesel employees, so the fact they were willing to get involved speaks volumes about the passion our people have for this home-grown Kiwi business.</p>

            <p class="justify">“We also wanted to demonstrate the new TX Rubber Tracks are made to suit a wide variety of New Zealand conditions and applications, ranging from residential through to commercial construction sites, all the while being able to navigate uneven terrain and challenging conditions.</p>

            <p class="justify">“It’s a light hearted look at the wide range of operating locations where a small excavator might be found, with a few unusual places thrown in for good measure - it’s well worth a view.”</p>
