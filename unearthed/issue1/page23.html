            <p class="justify">To coincide with the launch of the new TX Rubber Track, the team at TransDiesel created an advertisement for the product. Starring many TransDiesel employees, the team’s involvement speaks volumes about the passion our people have for this home-grown Kiwi business.</p>

            <p class="justify">“We had a lot of fun producing the commercial which supports this new product release. We wanted to demonstrate the new TX Rubber Tracks are made to suit a wide variety of New Zealand conditions.  It’s a light hearted look at the wide range of operating locations where a small excavator might be found, with a few unusual places thrown in for good measure - it’s definitely worth a view – you might recognises some faces,” said Marketing Manager, Marc Warr.</p>
