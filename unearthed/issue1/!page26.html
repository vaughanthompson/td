            <h4>Back in 2012 TransDiesel was successful in tendering to supply and install two marine engines for the Sumner Offshore Life Rescue Boat in Christchurch.</h4>

			<p class="justify">We selected the Megatec engines which at the time were being tested by mtu in anticipation that these would then become an mtu supported marine option. mtu systems are used to power yachts, tugboats and land vehicles and provide energy for many mission-critical applications. </p>         
			<p class="justify">However, during the initial sea trial the Starboard engine failed and had to be removed from the boat for repairs. During that process we encountered two further failures and several manufacturing defects were identified. The TransDiesel team resolved the issues internally as Megatech were unable to provide any long-term solutions.</p>         
			<p class="justify">Following completion of the work and subsequent testing, the engines were reinstalled into the lifeboat and a successful sea trial was conducted. However, a short time later, injector failures began to occur on the engines.</p>     
            <p class="justify">This type of failure is extremely rare, and we did not know the exact cause. </p>

            <p class="justify">While TransDiesel staff, Megatech and other specialists sought a solution, none proved to be long term, so a decision was made to remove both engines and allow for some concentrated investigative analysis to be undertaken.</p>
            <p class="justify">Once the engines were back in the TransDiesel workshop the team undertook some delving into the dark arts of diesel fuel injection, followed by heavy modifications to the fuel injection system.</p>
            <p class="justify">Following comprehensive testing the engines were re-installed into the boat and success was secured with subsequent sea trials proving nothing short of amazing.</p>         
			<p class="justify">TransDiesel had identified a successful solution to a long-term and gnarly problem. Our work in partnership with the Sumner Lifeboat Institution was acknowledged and despite the issues we had a satisfied customer.</p>         
			<p class="justify"><strong>Here at TransDiesel we donâ€™t give up easily and go the extra mile to secure success.</strong>
