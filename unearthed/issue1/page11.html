            <p class="justify">So, it was an eye opener last year at our leadership summit when legal expert in occupational health and Safety and partner at Chapman Tripp, Garth Galloway, asked why H & S was not part of our Vision and Values. A great question, and one we have quickly moved to answer. Health and Safety has now been incorporated into our value for passion.</p>
