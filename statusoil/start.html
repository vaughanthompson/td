                            <p>We strongly recommend that all fluid extractions be undertaken by service technicians, as hot fluids, electrical discharges and high pressures can be hazardous to the untrained operator. There are ideal conditions, tools and specific compartments that can only de identified by a trained mechanic professional.</p>

                            <p>A “mid-stream” sample is recommended, regardless of whether the extraction is being carried out with a pump or a drain plug, as the oil that comes out immediately or towards the end of the extraction may contain metals or debris which can yield you inaccurate test results.</p>

                            <p>We don’t recommend extracting samples from dipstick tubes or oil filters as this can yield false results due to the abnormal concentration of debris.</p>

                            <p>To avoid unnecessary expenditure due to sample cross contamination, we recommend that whomever is responsible for taking the samples be included in the feedback process and success of the extraction.</p>

                            <p>Labelling a sample correctly expedites the process and ensures consistent and accurate data. Please <a href="Labelling-a-sample.pdf" target="_blank">download our step-by-step PDF here</a>.</p>

                            <p>Our reports are sent via email once the testing is complete, results reviewed and evaluated by a professional technician. These emails also contain a PDF attachment which can be printed or sent to interested parties.</p>

                            <p>You can expect your results within two working days (of physical receipt of the sample). If you have not received the results in this timeframe, <a href="mailto:lubessupport@transdiesel.co.nz">email us</a> or call +64 03 344 8415 as we may have problems identifying your sample due to <a href="Labelling-a-sample.pdf" target="_blank">incomplete label information</a>.</p>

                            <p>Sample reports can be used at a high level to prioritize work by simply looking at the Evaluation Code. These evaluation codes are best thought of as a priority coding system for any action that needs to be taken.</p>

                            <p>For example, oil that has been extracted at the end of a long drain interval may be depleted and not suitable for further use, but if these results are normal for the hours the machine has done and the label indicates that the oil has been changed, then no further action needs to be taken and therefore this sample may receive an A result.</p>

May be used to highlight an increase in results or where results are atypical (excluding additives), but remain within the published normal limit range.<br> Something requires monitoring or information is required at the next scheduled service opportunity.</p>

                            <p>ABNORMAL - Action should be taken at the earliest opportunity to investigate and rectify the issue. Failure to do so may result in shortened component life and potential failure.</p>
